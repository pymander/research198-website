title: About Freemasonry
---

Freemasonry is a philosophy and practice of morality and ethics
imparted to its members through the symbolic use of the tools of
ancient stonemasons and by initiation ceremonies based upon rituals
that are centuries old. 

Freemasonry is built upon three basic tenets or principles: Brotherly
Love, Relief, and Truth. 

- **Brotherly Love** is the practice of the Golden Rule. 
- **Relief** embodies charity for all mankind. 
- **Truth** is honesty, fair play, and adherence to the cardinal
  virtues of Temperance, Fortitude, Prudence, and Justice.
