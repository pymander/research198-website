It's November, and time for our next installment of **Read, Listen, Watch**! Since this month is all about elections in both our civic lives and our lodges, let's learn more about democracy.

## Important Dates This Month

- Scottish Rite Reunion: November 4-5
  - Our Worshipful Master will be hard at work, so send him encouraging words!
- Stated Meeting: Saturday, November 19th
  - **We're having elections this month!**

## Read

- Since November is election time for both our civic life and our lodges, how about this: [Freemasonry and Democracy](https://www.masonicworld.com/education/articles/freemasonry_and_democracy.htm)
- [The Monumental Fall of Babylon](https://www.ancient-origins.net/ancient-places-europe/fall-babylon-0011090) for those who enjoyed the 21° back in September.

## Listen
- [Revolutions Podcast](http://www.sal.wisc.edu/~jwp/revolutions-episode-index.html) by Mike Duncan is a *great* podcast that explores the history of how some of our great democracies got started.

## Watch

Okay, enough with the heavy lifting. Now let's have something lighter.

-   [Birthday Campout in a Rainforest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6drrGdtzwk&t=3s) — Support a brother's YouTube channel! A small group of
    Freemasons (some familiar faces?) went camping at the Masonic Campground up in Washington
    earlier this year.
